# hangman-game

I've build this timeless game as I have always enjoyed playing it with friends,hope you will have as much fun playing it as I had building it!
Game built in vanilla javascript and styled and made it responsive in Sass.

## Features

The game randomly generates words <br>
For every word the user can see the topic releated to the word on the top <br>
If the user gueeses the words with half of the words' letters displayed, the user get 10 points, otherwise 5. <br>
When the user failed to guess the word and lose, the user is going to see his score displayed and have the option to start a new game.
